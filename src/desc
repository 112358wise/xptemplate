    Like all of us writing the first program, let's hello to XPTemplate.

    The default key stroke to trigger a snippet is Ctrl-backslash. Without anything typed, C-\ shows all snippet in pop up menu. Like this.

    We can navigate through them to choose one. And pressing C-\ to trigger it, or using <tab> to trigger it.

    We choose the "main" snippet, press <tab> and good, we got a main function and cursor stays where it should be.
